## 🌱 Overview

The Smart Crop Advisory System is a comprehensive web application designed to empower small and marginal farmers with AI-powered agricultural intelligence. This platform addresses the critical gap in personalized, real-time advisory services by providing scientific insights in farmers' native languages.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

**Problem Description:**
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history.

**Impact:** This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

**Why This Needs to Be Solved:** Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation.

- ✅ **Multilingual AI-based mobile app/chatbot** with real-time, location-specific crop advisory
- ✅ **Soil health recommendations** and personalized fertilizer guidance
